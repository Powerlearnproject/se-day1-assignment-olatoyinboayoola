Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Sofware engineering involves writing codes for computers. 
Sofware engineering helps to solve world problems with the use of technology
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 it includes the development of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design: creating high level and detailed designs of the software achitecture and user face
implementation: writing code and building software according to the design specifications
testing: Conducting various tests 
deployment: releasing the software to users or customers
maintenace: providing support and enhancements to the software after deployment
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developers write codes and implement software solutions
quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test
project managers oversees the planning execution and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual studio, Eclipse
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Subversion
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, Tight Deadlines, technical debts
effective communication, agile methodologies,task prioritization
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is the testing of individual components or modules of software
integration testing is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems
system testing is the testing of the entire software system as a whole
acceptance testing is the testing of the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
